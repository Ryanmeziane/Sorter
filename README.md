# Sorter - Visual Sorting Algorithm Demonstrator

## Introduction

Sorter is a web-based application designed to visually demonstrate various sorting algorithms. It offers an interactive and engaging way to understand different sorting methods, showing them in action in real-time.

## Features

- **Dynamic Array Creation**: Users can input the size of the array they wish to sort.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: The sorting process is visualized live on a canvas, providing a clear view of the algorithm's execution.
- **Various Sorting Algorithms**: Includes Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and Bogo Sort.
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can easily select different sorting algorithms and array sizes for experimentation.

## How to Use

### Setting Up

1. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.

### Operating Instructions

1. Input the desired size of the array in the designated field.
2. Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
3. Click 'Render' to start the visualization.
4. Watch as the canvas dynamically displays the sorting algorithm sorting the array in real-time.

### Description of Sorting Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Quick Sort**: An efficient, divide-and-conquer algorithm, which works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
- **Insertion Sort**: It builds the final sorted array one item at a time, placing the current item into its correct position within the sorted portion of the array.
- **Bogo Sort**: A highly inefficient method that generates random arrangements of the array until it finds one that is sorted (It's kinda funny).
